    <h3>Stemming</h3>
    <p>Stemming is NLP technique that lower inflection in words to their root forms<br>
      hence helps in the processing of text, words and coucments for text normalization.<br><br>
      
      Inflection is the process through which a words is modified to communicate many grammatical categories, including tense, case voice, aspect
      ,person, number, gender and mood.<br> thus althought a word may exist in several inflected forms, having multiple inflected forms inside the same text
      adds redundancy to the NLP process.<br>
      as result we emply stemming to reduce words to their basic form or stem, which may or may not be legitimate word in language.

    <h4>types</h4>
    <p>
      1. port stemmer: PorterStemmer():<br>
      Porter Stemmer is the original stemmer and is renowned for its ease of use and rapidity.<br>
      Frequently the resultant stem in a shorter word with the same root meaning.<br>
      2. SnowBall stemmer: SnowballStemmer(): <br>
      The method is utilized in this instance is more precise and is referred to "English stemmer" or "Porter2Stemmer"<br>
      It is somewhat faster and more logical than the orginal porter Stemmer<br>
      3. Lancaster stemmer: LancasterStemmer(): <br>
      Produces results with excessive stemming, Overstemming renders stems non-linguistic or meaningless.<br>
      4. RegexpStemer (Regular Expression stemming algorithm):<br>
      With the help of this stemming algorithm, we can construct our own stemmer.<br>
      RegexpStemmer class with the help of which we can easily implement Regular Expression Stemmer algorithms. It basically takes a single regular expression and removes any prefix or suffix that matches the expression.<br>
